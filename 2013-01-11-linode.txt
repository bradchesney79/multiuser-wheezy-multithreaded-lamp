Base debian 6 32-bit linode.com Virtual Private Server install

(On linode build images, the ssh package is preinstalled for you.

apt-get install ssh
on the server for everyone else without it.

ifconfig
to get your IP address.
You may only have access via the local network at that address. Google "NAT")

login via ssh as root
ssh root@012.345.678.910

get the screen program
apt-get install screen

start the screen window program
screen

Basic screen command line commands

start the screen window program
screen

see running screen windows
screen -ls

reattach to a screen window
screen -r <pid.connection.hostname>
(your pid.connection.hostname will vary)

Basic screen keybindings

create an additional window in screen
CTRL+a+c

switch to the next window in the forward direction
CTRL+a+n

switch to the next window in the forward direction
CTRL+a+p

see a list of windows
CTRL+a+w

switch to a specific window
CTRL+a+"
(" = SHIFT+')

kill the current window
CTRL+a+k
(if it is the last window, screen will close and return you to the command line)

detatch from all windows leaving screen running and return to the command line
CTRL+a+d

once screen is up update and upgrade the system
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade

install the kernel metapackage
apt-get install linux-image-2.6.32-5-686

(apt-get install linux-image-2.6.32-5-amd64 for AMD64 based 64-bit machines)

test that the new kernel metapackage is installed (pray you see output)
dpkg -l "linux-image*" | grep ^ii

I get one line that starts with "ii" followed by the package name, the dotted numeric version, and a short text description.

verify everything is in good order (no output is what you want)
dpkg --audit
aptitude search "~ahold"
apt-get clean

a second dialog will pop up to confirm there were no typos or give you the opportunity to enter identical typos which is another way to look at it.



mysql_secure_installation


=====Script Output=====

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!


In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL
root user without the proper authorisation.

You already have a root password set, so you can safely answer 'n'.

Change the root password? [Y/n] n
 ... skipping.

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y 
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...



All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MySQL!

mysql -uroot -p

USE mysql


A common vector is to attack the MySQL root user since it is the default omipotent user put on almost all MySQL installs.
So, give your 'root' user a different name. (Is admin more secure than root, meh. Yeah, I guess.)


GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pwork' WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'pwork' WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'pwork' WITH GRANT OPTION;


CREATE USER 'backup'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, RELOAD, REPLICATION CLIENT, EVENT, TRIGGER ON *.* TO 'backup'@'localhost';


So, the debian-sys-maint user is used by a lot of stuff. And it would serve to break more than I can justify it saves. I fundamentally disagree with the debian-sys-maint user, but that is the mumblings of a first class nobody-significant.

Do nothing with the debian-sys-maint user. :(

There are settings dropped into /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php automatically, notably all the table names for phpmyadmin and a few others.


You can look through it if you want, no changes will be made.
vi /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php



Likewise for /usr/share/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php
this is the last bastion that phpmyadmin looks at for it's configuration-- this is where the things you want to have set need to be (so they overwrite undesirable settings) or be missing (so the preferred settings set elsewhere are not overwritten).

vi /usr/share/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

mysql -uadmin -p

DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root';
    
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

EXIT


/var/lib/phpmyadmin/blowfish_secret.inc.php
-just make sure the secret in here is the same as in all the other something.inc.php files.


/usr/sbin/pma-secure

delete the phpmyadmin config directory-- you are done configuring via wide swaths, it is just fine tuning that can be done in a text editor by sysadmins now.

{{{{{Step 3}}}}}

	#   Access Control:
	#   With SSLRequire you can do per-directory access control based
	#   on arbitrary complex boolean expressions containing server
	#   variable checks and other lookup directives.  The syntax is a
	#   mixture between C and Perl.  See the mod_ssl documentation
	#   for more details.
	#<Location />
	#SSLRequire (    %{SSL_CIPHER} !~ m/^(EXP|NULL)/ \
	#	    and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_O} eq "Snake Oil, Ltd." \
	#	    and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_OU} in {"Staff", "CA", "Dev"} \
	#	    and %{TIME_WDAY} >= 1 and %{TIME_WDAY} <= 5 \

	#	   or %{REMOTE_ADDR} =~ m/^192\.76\.162\.[0-9]+$/
	#</Location>

	#   SSL Engine Options:
	#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
	#   o FakeBasicAuth:
	#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
	#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
	#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
	#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
	#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
	#   o ExportCertData:
	#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
	#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
	#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
	#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
	#     into CGI scripts.
	#   o StdEnvVars:
	#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
	#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
	#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
	#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
	#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
	#   o StrictRequire:
	#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
	#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
	#     and no other module can change it.
	#   o OptRenegotiate:
	#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
	#     directives are used in per-directory context.

	#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
	#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
	#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
	#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
	#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
	#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
	#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
	#     works correctly.
	#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	#   "force-response-1.0" for this.
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
	# MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive

vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

-----/etc/apache2/apache2.conf-----

# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2-common/README.Debian.gz about
# Debian specific hints.
#
#
# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:
# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to
# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's
# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,
# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in
# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
# possible.

# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
#
#       /etc/apache2/
#       |-- apache2.conf
#       |       `--  ports.conf
#       |-- mods-enabled
#       |       |-- *.load
#       |       `-- *.conf
#       |-- conf.d
#       |       `-- *
#       `-- sites-enabled
#               `-- *
#
#
# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
#   web server.
#
#   In order to avoid conflicts with backup files, the Include directive is
#   adapted to ignore files that:
#   - do not begin with a letter or number
#   - contain a character that is neither letter nor number nor _-:.
#   - contain .dpkg
#
#   Yet we strongly suggest that all configuration files either end with a
#   .conf or .load suffix in the file name. The next Debian release will
#   ignore files not ending with .conf (or .load for mods-enabled).
#
#
# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is
#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections, and which
#   of these ports are used for name based virtual hosts.
#
# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories
#   contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules or virtual
#   host configurations, respectively.
#
#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their
#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our
#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite. See
#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
#
# * Configuration files in the conf.d directory are either provided by other
#   packages or may be added by the local administrator. Local additions
#   should start with local- or end with .local.conf to avoid name clashes. All
#   files in conf.d are considered (excluding the exceptions noted above) by
#   the Apache 2 web server.
#
# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in
#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with
#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not
#   work with the default configuration.

# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document

# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.
#
# It is also possible to omit any default MIME type and let the

; FPM Configuration ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; All relative paths in this configuration file are relative to PHP's install
; prefix (/usr). This prefix can be dynamicaly changed by using the
; '-p' argument from the command line.

; Include one or more files. If glob(3) exists, it is used to include a bunch of
; files from a glob(3) pattern. This directive can be used everywhere in the
; file.
; Relative path can also be used. They will be prefixed by:
;  - the global prefix if it's been set (-p arguement)
;  - /usr otherwise
include=/etc/php5/fpm/*.conf

; Pid file
; Note: the default prefix is /var
; Default Value: none

; Error log file
; If it's set to "syslog", log is sent to syslogd instead of being written
; in a local file.
; Note: the default prefix is /var
; Default Value: log/php-fpm.log
error_log = /var/log/php5-fpm.log

; syslog_facility is used to specify what type of program is logging the
; message. This lets syslogd specify that messages from different facilities
; will be handled differently.
; See syslog(3) for possible values (ex daemon equiv LOG_DAEMON)
; Default Value: daemon
syslog.facility = daemon

; syslog_ident is prepended to every message. If you have multiple FPM
; instances running on the same server, you can change the default value
; which must suit common needs.
; Default Value: php-fpm

; interval set by emergency_restart_interval then FPM will restart. A value
; of '0' means 'Off'.
; Default Value: 0

; Pool Definitions ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Multiple pools of child processes may be started with different listening
; ports and different management options.  The name of the pool will be
; used in logs and stats. There is no limitation on the number of pools which
; FPM can handle. Your system will tell you anyway :)

; To configure the pools it is recommended to have one .conf file per
; pool in the following directory:
include=/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/*.conf

;   php_value/php_flag             - you can set classic ini defines which can
;                                    be overwritten from PHP call 'ini_set'.

; For php_*flag, valid values are on, off, 1, 0, true, false, yes or no.

; Defining 'extension' will load the corresponding shared extension from
; extension_dir. Defining 'disable_functions' or 'disable_classes' will not
; overwrite previously defined php.ini values, but will append the new value
; instead.

; Note: path INI options can be relative and will be expanded with the prefix
; (pool, global or /usr)

	#   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
	#   the ssl-cert package. See
	#   /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for more info.
	#   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
	#   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
	SSLCertificateFile    /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
	SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

	#   Server Certificate Chain:
	#   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
	#   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
	#   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
	#   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
	#   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
	#   certificate for convinience.
	#SSLCertificateChainFile /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/server-ca.crt

	#   Certificate Authority (CA):
	#   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
	#   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
	#   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
	#   Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks
	#	 to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
	#	 Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
	#SSLCACertificatePath /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/
	#SSLCACertificateFile /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/ca-bundle.crt

	#   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
	#   Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client
	#   authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
	#   of them (file must be PEM encoded)
	#   Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks

	#SSLCARevocationPath /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/
	#SSLCARevocationFile /home/username/hostname.tld/certs/ca-bundle.crl

	#   Client Authentication (Type):
	#   Client certificate verification type and depth.  Types are
	#   none, optional, require and optional_no_ca.  Depth is a
	#   number which specifies how deeply to verify the certificate
	#   issuer chain before deciding the certificate is not valid.
	#SSLVerifyClient require
	#SSLVerifyDepth  10

	#   Access Control:
	#   With SSLRequire you can do per-directory access control based
	#   on arbitrary complex boolean expressions containing server
	#   variable checks and other lookup directives.  The syntax is a
	#   mixture between C and Perl.  See the mod_ssl documentation
	#   for more details.
	#<Location />
	#SSLRequire (    %{SSL_CIPHER} !~ m/^(EXP|NULL)/ \
	#	    and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_O} eq "Snake Oil, Ltd." \
	#	    and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_OU} in {"Staff", "CA", "Dev"} \
	#	    and %{TIME_WDAY} >= 1 and %{TIME_WDAY} <= 5 \

	#	   or %{REMOTE_ADDR} =~ m/^192\.76\.162\.[0-9]+$/
	#</Location>

	#   SSL Engine Options:
	#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
	#   o FakeBasicAuth:
	#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
	#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
	#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
	#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
	#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
	#   o ExportCertData:
	#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
	#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
	#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
	#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
	#     into CGI scripts.
	#   o StdEnvVars:
	#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
	#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
	#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
	#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
	#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
	#   o StrictRequire:
	#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
	#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
	#     and no other module can change it.
	#   o OptRenegotiate:
	#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
	#     directives are used in per-directory context.
	#SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +StrictRequire
	<FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">

	</Directory>

	#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
	#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
	#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
	#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
	#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
	#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
	#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
	#     works correctly.
	#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	#   "force-response-1.0" for this.
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
	# MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
